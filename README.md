# Data Import and Cleaning
### Read in the saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-2008.csv and saudi-arabia-driving-licenses-2004-2008.csv files and assign them to appropriately named pandas dataframes.

### dropping duplicate columns.
. Investigate missing values etc.
. counting missing value in Licenses
. finding the max and min
. finding out types of our data 
. Fix incorrect data types
. taking out the pranthesis from data 
. taking out 'n' from Driving Liceses and traffic accidents 
. change year,and Value to type int data and Geo point to float
. split GEO point colums for data
. Rename columns more clear names as specifiy 
. Drop unnecessary rows with total value 
. Changing formats of data by splitting into more coulmns 
. merge tow datas onto one big one.
. Save your cleaned, merged dataframe to csv file 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

. Summary Statistics for our data 
. calculating stander deviation 
. Investigate trends in the data

# Visualize the data

. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas .corr() to visualize correlations between all numeric features
. custom function to draw histograms

. plot and interpret scatter plots
For each of the following:
. Driving Licenses vs. Traffic Accidents for 2017
. Driving Licenses vs. Traffic Accidents for 2016
. Driving Licenses for 2016 vs 2017
. Traffic Accidents for 2016 vs 2017
. Plot and interpret boxplots

. Only include variables of a similar scale
. Have clear labels for each variable
. Have appropriate titles and labels

. i plot number of accidents and region to illustrate highest region and lowest and continue for further analysis 

# Outside Research

. i decide to do further analysis on northean regions because they have the lowest of all the regions 
. plot my observation on scatter plot
